# NLP-Powered Customer Review Analysis

An intelligent system for analyzing e-commerce customer reviews using text embeddings and semantic search. This project demonstrates advanced NLP techniques to extract insights from customer feedback, enabling automated topic categorization and similarity-based search.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews dataset** to understand customer sentiments and feedback patterns. Using state-of-the-art text embedding techniques, the system can:

- **Categorize reviews** by topics (quality, fit, style, comfort)
- **Find similar reviews** using semantic search
- **Visualize customer sentiment patterns** in 2D space
- **Enable data-driven business decisions** through automated analysis

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Text Embedding Generation
Converts customer reviews into high-dimensional vector representations using advanced embedding algorithms, capturing semantic meaning beyond simple keyword matching.

### 2. Topic Categorization
Automatically identifies and groups reviews discussing similar themes:
- Product Quality
- Fit and Sizing
- Style and Design
- Comfort and Wearability

### 3. Semantic Search Engine
Retrieves the most similar reviews for any given input, enabling:
- Personalized customer service responses
- Pattern recognition in customer complaints
- Discovery of related feedback

### 4. Visual Analysis
Applies dimensionality reduction (t-SNE/UMAP) to create intuitive 2D visualizations, revealing clusters and patterns in customer sentiment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text embeddings, semantic analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib/Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
